## Who I am
Hello, I'm Michael Harris. I'm currently a community college graduate with an A.S in Computer Science.
I consider myself a C programmer, but I'm knowledgeable in other languages.
My goal is to become a Linux Kernel Developer.

## What I've done
I'm currently interning as a web developer where I am learning the development process and testing of websites. I've begun to learn the value of JSON files, in addition to debugging webpages.

I've worked as a computer science tutor at a local community college, where it was my job to guide students in C++ and data structures, as well as create a friendly environment for the student's learning.

As a young teenager, I got experience working in a couple computer shops and a computer distributor, where I began to learn the ins and outs of computers, and I got to know and understand them on a physical level.
